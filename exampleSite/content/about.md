I’m Vega Byte—a wanderer between code and chrome, breathing synthwave life into cold digital spaces.

Born with a terminal in one hand and a synth in the other, I’ve always believed that technology should illuminate the soul, not obscure it. My fascination lies at the intersection of glitch aesthetics, retro interfaces, and the bold optimism of futures past.

By day, I conjure cybernetic layouts, pixel art, and interactive experiences that hum with neon brilliance. By night, you’ll find me sculpting code into sound and color, chasing that perfect blend where analogue nostalgia meets digital innovation.

**What I Do:**
- Build hyper-responsive, visually electric sites using Hugo and Tailwind CSS
- Create glitchy, animated art that evokes the shimmering uncertainty of the early digital era
- Automate, optimize, and remix everything—from code to workflow—to keep creativity flowing
- Collect rare synthwave vinyl and tinker with hardware mods to bring the past into the present

**Beliefs & Vibes:**
- The Internet should feel alive: luminous, dynamic, and welcoming to dreamers and outcasts alike
- Accessibility and speed are never optional—no matter how wild the visuals may get
- Imperfection is beautiful; a glitch is an opportunity for art
- Community is everything—open source, open minds, open hearts

Come ride with me through this endless digital night.  
If you’re ready to build a corner of the web that pulses with real character, let’s connect!
