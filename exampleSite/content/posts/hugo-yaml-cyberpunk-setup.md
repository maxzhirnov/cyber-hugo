tags: ["theme", "setup"]
summary: "Plug into the neon grid! This guide jacks you straight into configuring your hugo.yaml for the Cyber-Hugo theme—covering every setting, from menus to terminal widgets, so your site pulses with Blade Runner energy and hacker precision. Deploy your digital city with style."
---

### 1. [CORE SETTINGS] :: Identity Matrix

```yaml
theme: cyber-hugo
languageCode: en-us
baseURL: "https://maxzhirnov.github.io/cyber-hugo/"
relativeURLs: false
canonifyURLs: true
title: Cyber Theme
pagination:
  pagerSize: 10
```

- **theme**: Activates the *cyber-hugo* neural skin.
- **languageCode**: Sets your system language.
- **baseURL**: Your site’s root in cyberspace.
- **relativeURLs/canonifyURLs**: Clean, canonical URLs for max traceability.
- **title**: Terminal title bar.
- **pagerSize**: Posts per page—scroll the feed, cyber style.

---

### 2. [BUILD OPS] :: Cache, Compile, and Mount

```yaml
build:
  buildStats:
    enable: true
  cachebusters:
  - source: assets/notwatching/hugo_stats\.json
    target: css
  - source: (postcss|tailwind)\.config\.js
    target: css

module:
  mounts:
  - source: assets
    target: assets
  - disableWatch: true
    source: hugo_stats.json
    target: assets/notwatching/hugo_stats.json
```

- **buildStats**: Fires up Hugo’s stats collector, which scans your templates for every Tailwind utility class you use. This lets Tailwind purge unused CSS and generate only what your site actually needs—keeping your stylesheets razor-thin and your load times lightning-fast. No wasted bytes, just pure neon.

- **cachebusters**: These rules are your anti-ghost protocol. Whenever you tweak your Tailwind or PostCSS config, or when Hugo’s stats file changes, cachebusters force a CSS rebuild and make browsers fetch the latest version. This guarantees you’ll never see stale or broken styles haunting your site—every deploy is fresh from the grid.

- **module.mounts**: This is your file system wiring. It tells Hugo where to find and serve your assets (like images, fonts, and CSS) and ensures that the all-important `hugo_stats.json` (generated by buildStats) is mounted exactly where Tailwind expects to find it. The `disableWatch: true` flag prevents unnecessary rebuilds, keeping your development workflow smooth and efficient.

> **Heads up:**  
> This setup isn’t optional for Tailwind + Hugo. It’s straight from the [official Hugo Tailwind docs](https://gohugo.io/functions/css/tailwindcss/), and it’s the backbone that keeps your cyberpunk theme running sharp and responsive. Skip these steps and you risk broken styles, sluggish reloads, and a site that’s more glitch than glow.

**In short:**  
This build and module configuration is your site’s power grid—fueling live-reloading, cache-busting, and asset delivery, all optimized for that slick, cyberpunk experience.  
Plug it in, and your theme will always look as fresh as a midnight city skyline.

### 3. [MARKUP] :: Neon Syntax & TOC

```yaml
markup:
  highlight:
    codeFences: true
    guessSyntax: false
    lineNos: false
    noClasses: false
    style: monokai
  tableOfContents:
    startLevel: 2
    endLevel: 4
    ordered: false
```

- **highlight**: Code blocks glow in *Monokai*—like neon on rain-slick streets.
- **tableOfContents**: Auto-generate a TOC for your docs. Only the essentials, operator.
